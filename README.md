📌 Day-3: Striver’s A2Z – Hashing (Frequency + Dictionary)
Repo: https://github.com/Arpithajain26/day-3-of-solving-problems.git

Today’s concept was Hashing 🔐 — one of the most important topics in competitive programming and coding interviews!

We covered:
✔️ Counting frequency of numbers ➕
✔️ Counting frequency of characters 🅰️🅱️
✔️ Using Python Dictionary to store and retrieve counts efficiently 🧠⚡

Hashing makes it easy to track how many times each value appears in an array/string using key–value pairs — super powerful and fast! 🚀
